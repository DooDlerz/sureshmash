                        <p class="py-4 text-dark">Perhaps the most confusing decision in any individual’s life is what
                            to do
                            after class 10? The choice
                            of stream at this point sometimes shapes the decisions for years to come, and have long
                            lasting
                            consequences on a student’s life. While most other tests provide specific top 5 or 10
                            specific
                            occupations, the Career Spark Basic for Grade 10 streamlines the decision making process
                            itself.
                            The
                            results will provide you with broad level career clusters and pathways most suited to you as
                            per
                            your psychometric profile. Your results will provide an easy way for you to explore the
                            world of
                            work comprehensively and decide on the stream and subjects to pursue, without having to make
                            rigid
                            and specific career choices so early in your life.</p>

                        <p class="py-4 text-dark">Cyber security is important because government, military, corporate,
                            financial, and medical
                            organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and
                            other
                            devices. A significant portion of that data can be sensitive information, whether that be
                            intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for
                            which
                            unauthorized access or exposure could have negative consequences. Organizations transmit
                            sensitive
                            data across networks and to other devices in the course of doing businesses, and cyber
                            security
                            describes the discipline dedicated to protecting that information and the systems used to
                            process or
                            store it. As the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks grow, companies and
                            organizations,
                            especially those that are tasked with safeguarding information relating to national
                            security,
                            health, or financial records, need to take steps to protect their sensitive business and
                            personnel
                            information. As early as March 2013, the nation’s top intelligence officials cautioned that
                            cyber
                            attacks and digital spying are the top threat to national security, eclipsing even
                            terrorism.</p>

                            President
                            of India is the Supreme
                            Commander of the Indian Navy. The Chief of Naval Staff, a four-star admiral, commands the
                            navy.

                            The Indian Navy traces its origins back to the East India Company's Marine which was founded
                            in 1612
                            to protect British merchant shipping in the region. In 1793, the British East India Company
                            established its rule over eastern part of the Indian subcontinent i.e. Bengal, but it was
                            not until
                            1830 that the colonial navy was titled as His Majesty's Indian Navy. When India became a
                            republic in
                            1950, the Royal Indian Navy as it had been named since 1934 was renamed to Indian Navy.
